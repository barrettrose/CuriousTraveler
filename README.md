# CuriousTraveler

Recreating my User Interaction Engineering website prototype into a fully coded website.  Website was a travel focused informative website/prototype hosted on Axure called Curious Traveler.  Link to prototype can be found here: https://s8gj15.axshare.com/#id=j1ors8&p=home

Instructions for website included:
   * Home Page
   * About Me Page 
   * Two Content Pages - Showcase something informative to support the site's topic
      * Peru
      * China
   * Data Visualization Page - Creatively visualize some data set of our choice to support the site's topic.
      * Destination Map - View locations I have previously been to and want to go to in the future.
   * Interactive Page - Allow the user to interact with the site in some way that is creative (no user registration, shopping cart, or contact us email interactivity)
      * Find a Destination - Using five sliders representing a desired characteristic of the location the user is searching for, a location will be suggested that tries to best                              accomodate the selected characterstics the user entered.  NOTE: THIS FEATURE DOES NOT WORK!  Functionality was not required for this page, therefore                              the locations returned are generated randomly regardless of user input.
   * Website must follow design, color, and font guidelines learned in the class.
